In order to use mongodb one must install the pymongo connector

From an activated shell execute
  pip install pymongo

You also need to pre-create your database in MongoDB before running this historian
For example, to create a local MongoDB, do the followings in Mongo shell:
    - Switch to the new database "volttron_guide":
        use volttron_guide
    - Create a new user for "volttron_guide":
        db.createUser({user: "admin", pwd: "admin", roles: ["readWrite"] })
